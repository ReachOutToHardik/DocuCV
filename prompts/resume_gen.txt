**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.  **CONTENT QUALITY (The "Industry Standard"):**
    *   **STAR Method**: Rewrite every bullet point using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
    *   **Quantify Results**: ALWAYS add numbers. (e.g., "Reduced latency by 40%", "Managed $50k budget"). If exact numbers aren't provided, estimate reasonable metrics based on the context.
    *   **Action Verbs**: Start every bullet with a strong power verb (e.g., "Architected", "Spearheaded", "Optimized", "Deployed").
    *   **No Fluff**: Remove passive voice and generic statements like "Responsible for...".
    *   **Summary**: Write a 3-line "Professional Summary" that highlights their years of experience, key tech stack, and biggest achievement. Tailor it to the "{{targetRole}}".

2.  **LATEX SYNTAX RULES (Prevent Compilation Errors):**
    *   **Escape Special Characters**: You MUST escape these characters: `&` -> `\&`, `%` -> `\%`, `$` -> `\$`, `#` -> `\#`, `_` -> `\_`.
    *   **No Markdown**: Do NOT use bold `**` or italics `*` inside the LaTeX code unless the template specifically uses LaTeX commands like `\textbf{}`.
    *   **Structure**: Keep the exact structure of the provided template. Do not invent new commands.
    *   **Lists**: Ensure `\begin{itemize}` always has a matching `\end{itemize}`.

3.  **IMAGE HANDLING:**
